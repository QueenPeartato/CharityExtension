Connect the Google API script to our manifest
Guide: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18681803/loading-google-api-javascript-client-library-into-chrome-extension 

There are several solutions here, but the simplest and most universal seems to be connecting the API 
script to the manifest: 
  "background": {
  "scripts": [
    "background.js",
    "gapi-client.js"
  ]
}), 

this uses a main background script (background.js) to which all of the gapi-client.js is copied (away from it's
online location) and applied to our manifest. 

 The script in background.js looks like this:
 
 window.gapi_onload = function(){
  console.log('gapi loaded.', gapi.auth, gapi.client);

  // Do things you want with gapi.auth and gapi.client.
}

My assumption is that we won't have to do much more with gapi.auth and gapi.client.

This is the link to the api script:

Potentially use Materialize collapsible tiles for different charities/locations
